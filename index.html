            Why Does It <span>Works?</span>
        </h1>
        <p>Not all probiotics are created equal. The overall biological action exerted by a probiotic is not simply the sum of the actions of its individual components, but the result of a complex network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and between these and the human host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained by CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description. </p>
        <p>
            CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and enzymatic profile and specifically combined in precise proportions that allow them to act synergistically on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal system.It is essential to highlight that the production of De Simone Formulation is in the field of biology and not chemistry, since the bacteria that form the basis of the product are living organisms.Their cultivation requires advanced scientific knowledge and specific know-how, which is still protected by trade secrets.
        </p>
            <p>
            The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone, which includes specific trade secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and effectiveness of the CDS22-formula, making  it extremely difficult for others to replicate or produce an identical or functionally equivalent product.  <br> Backed by solid scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management of <br> dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering proven and replicable clinical results.</p>

            <p>The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the only probiotic formulation recommended and recognized by name in the American College of Gastroenterology AGA guidelines for the  management of pouchitis and other pouch related disorders (Olleik et al., Gastroenterology, Vol. 164, No. 6, 2023).
                
                </p>
                <p>His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal flora s role was just beginning to be understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of L’Aquila (Italy).
              </p>
               <p>
                 He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book chapters.</p>
                <p>Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation and qualitycontrol of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risks.</p>
                <p>As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing substantial differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product (De Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018).</p>
                <p>
              Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and safety of the commercially distributed probiotic product.</p>

      <p>The lack of strict regulation and the   possibility for manufacturers to modify formulations without adequately informing consumers pose a threat to public trust.
     In the past, the De Simone Formulation (DSF) was sold under the brand name VSL#3®*, by VSL Pharmaceuticals and Actial Srl.

      <p>
         In 2019, VSL#3® distributors were found guilty of false advertising (for more information:Federal Judge Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of

Recently, the European Crohn s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) has updated its guidelines to clarify that pre-2016 literature references to VSL#3® exclusively refer to DSF (ECCO, ECCO News, 2023). In 2024, ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism) published
