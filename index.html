            The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone,
            which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and
            efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely difficult for others to replicate or
            produce an identical or functionally equivalent product.
    
            Supported by solid scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the
            dietary management of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering
            proven and replicable clinical results.
