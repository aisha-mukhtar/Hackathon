            Why Does It <span>Works?</span>
        </h1>
        <p>
          Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is notsimply the sum of its individual components actions but the result of a complex network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and the human host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained
          from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description. </p>
        <p>
            CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and enzymatic profile and specifically combined in precise proportions that allow them to act synergistically on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal system.It is essential to highlight that the production of De Simone Formulation is in the field of biology and not chemistry, since the bacteria that form the basis of the product are living organisms.Their cultivation requires advanced scientific knowledge and specific know-how, which is still protected by trade secrets.CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and
            enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in precise proportions to synergistically act on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal tract.
    
            It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazione De Simone falls within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product sbase are living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy.

            <p>The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the only probiotic formulation recommended and recognized by name in the American College of Gastroenterology AGA guidelines for the  management of pouchitis and other pouch related disorders (Olleik et al., Gastroenterology, Vol. 164, No. 6, 2023).
                
                </p>
                <p>His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal flora s role was just beginning to be understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of Lâ€™Aquila (Italy).
              </p>
               <p>
                 He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book chapters.</p>
                <p>Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation and qualitycontrol of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risks.</p>
                <p>As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing substantial differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product (De Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018).</p>

      <p>The lack of strict regulation and the   possibility for manufacturers to modify formulations without adequately informing consumers pose a threat to public trust.
     In the past, the De Simone Formulation (DSF) was sold under the brand name VSL#3Â®*, by VSL Pharmaceuticals and Actial Srl.
        </p>
      <p>
         In 2019, VSL#3Â® distributors were found guilty of false advertising (for more information:Federal Judge Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of
         VSL#3, Schulman Bhattacharya). Recently, the European Crohn s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) has updated its guidelines to clarify that pre-2016 literature references to VSL#3Â® exclusively refer to DSF (ECCO, ECCO News, 2023). In 2024, ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism) published
          the article â€œClarifying Correct Attributions in Scientific Literature: The Case of the De Simone Formulation and VSL#3Â®â€œ, which reiterates the abov
